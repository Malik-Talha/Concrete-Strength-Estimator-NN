# Concrete Strength Regression Neural Network

## Overview

This project, named "Concrete Strength Regression Neural Network," was completed as part of an online course assignment. The objective of the assignment was to develop a regression model to predict concrete strength based on various features.

The project was so interesting because only instructions were provided and no code, file, or hints. I enjoyed the assignment project. The project was successfully completed and received a full mark for its implementation.

## Assignment Instructions

The detailed instructions for this assignment can be found in the `instructions.txt` file within this repository. The project is done in specific order according to the instructions in the 'instructions.txt' file. Please refer to that file for specific guidance on the assignment requirements and tasks.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `instructions.txt`: Detailed instructions for the assignment.
- 'concrete_strength_Regression_NN.ipynb' is the main code file in Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage

To reproduce or further explore the project, follow these steps:

1. Refer to the `instructions.txt` file for the specific tasks and requirements of the assignment.
2. Review the project files and code to understand the implementation.
3. You may run the code and experiments on your local machine or a suitable environment.
